//! Thin attach client — the `koma --attach` core (daemon stage 6).
//!
//! [`client_run`] connects to a running daemon's unix socket, attaches, and then
//! renders the daemon's state + forwards input. It does NONE of the real work:
//! no `service_all_sessions`, no turn machinery, no agent runtime. It maintains a
//! SHADOW [`AppState`] populated PURELY from the daemon's
//! [`DaemonEvent::Snapshot`] / [`DaemonEvent::Delta`] frames and feeds that shadow
//! to the EXISTING [`crate::view::draw`] — so the attach client renders identically
//! to a local TUI, with zero second render path to drift.
//!
//! # Session-lock ownership (daemon stage 8)
//!
//! Session locks (`session.lock`, holding the owner's PID — see
//! [`crate::model::store`]) are owned EXCLUSIVELY by the process that runs the
//! session lifecycle: the local TUI or the headless daemon. The client does the
//! real work through neither path — its [`SessionRuntime`]s are SHADOW copies
//! rebuilt from frames, never warmed, never saved, never the foreground of a real
//! turn. So this module deliberately calls NO lock function
//! (`store::write_lock` / `store::remove_lock` / `store::is_locked`) and never
//! `warm_session` / `reconcile_session_lock`. When a forwarded key drives a `/new`
//! or a foreground switch, it is the DAEMON's `apply_action` that writes the lock
//! (with the daemon's PID), not the client. Writing a lock here would stamp a
//! shadow session with the CLIENT's PID and corrupt the daemon's ownership.
//!
//! # Why a real `AppState` as the shadow
//!
//! `view::draw` reads only `state.rest` (in Chat mode) + `state.mode`. Rebuilding
//! a real [`AppState`] from each snapshot — one [`crate::app::state::SessionRuntime`]
//! per [`crate::ipc::proto::SessionSnapshot`], each carrying a reconstructed
//! [`crate::model::session::Session`] (messages + name + model) — lets the
//! unmodified chat renderer consume it directly. Non-render fields (channels,
//! abort handles, tool state machines) stay at their `Default`; the client never
//! advances a turn, so they are never read.
//!
//! # Transport bridge (mirrors the daemon's [`crate::ipc::conn`], client-side)
//!
//! The render loop is SYNCHRONOUS (crossterm draw + input poll). Socket I/O lives
//! in two tokio tasks bridged over `std::sync::mpsc`:
//! - a READER task: `read_frame_from` -> decode [`DaemonFrame`] -> push onto the
//!   loop's incoming `std::sync::mpsc::Sender<DaemonFrame>`. On EOF/error it drops
//!   the sender, which the loop observes as the daemon going away.
//! - a WRITER task: owns the outbound `std::sync::mpsc::Receiver<ClientRequest>`,
//!   polls it on a short interval, and writes each as a frame. (Same `!Sync`
//!   reasoning as `conn::write_loop`: a `std::sync::mpsc::Receiver` held across an
//!   await makes the future non-`Send`; collect-then-write keeps it off the await.)
//!
//! # Seq-gap recovery (critique #1)
//!
//! Every [`DaemonFrame`] carries a per-connection monotonic `seq`. The loop tracks
//! the next expected seq; on a gap it sends [`ClientRequest::Resync`] and DROPS
//! every frame until the fresh full [`DaemonEvent::Snapshot`] arrives (whose seq
//! reseeds the expectation), so one dropped delta can't leave a permanently-wrong
//! shadow.
//!
//! # Input forwarding (raw keys)
//!
//! Each terminal key is forwarded VERBATIM as [`ClientRequest::SendKey`]; the
//! daemon runs the SAME `controller::input::handle_key` + `apply_action` pipeline
//! the local TUI uses, so every high-level gesture — submitting a typed message,
//! `/resume` (the session hub / foreground switch), `/new` — works through forwarded keys with
//! no client-side command parsing to drift from the daemon. The ONE key the client
//! interprets locally is the detach gesture (Ctrl-C): it sends
//! [`ClientRequest::Detach`] and exits the client, leaving the daemon (and every
//! session) running.
