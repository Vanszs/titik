//! Runtime: the synchronous event loop that ties the whole app together.
//!
//! Owns the terminal, the tokio runtime handle, and the `AppState`. Its job is
//! the central cycle: drain the active request's [`StreamEvent`]s -> read
//! terminal input -> turn keystrokes into `Action`s -> apply them by mutating
//! state -> redraw. This is the only place that spawns async tasks and the only
//! place that calls `view::draw`.
//!
//! Rendering is dirty-flagged (draw only after something changes) and input
//! polling is adaptive (8ms while a request streams so tokens flush at >=60fps,
//! 100ms when idle) so a quiet UI burns no CPU.
//!
//! Async bridge: one channel per request. [`start_stream_task`] opens a fresh
//! channel, stashes the receiver in `state.rest.fg().active_rx`, and spawns a task
//! holding the sender. Cancelling (interrupt / `/new` / quit) just drops the
//! receiver, so a superseded task's late events vanish with no generation
//! bookkeeping.
